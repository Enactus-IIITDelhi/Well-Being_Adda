                I can vividly remember the time when I was in kindergarten, and no one would play with me solely because
                I wasn't fair-skinned enough. I was repeatedly told by the other children that I wasn't good enough to
                play with them due to my skin colour. I can also remember the time in second grade when no one at the
                table would talk to me and would refuse to share my tiffin because they believed it would be "polluted."
                As a child, I hated myself; I wished I could bleach my skin white so that the other kids would talk and
                play with me. But, then came fourth grade, when I won my first ever award for solo singing. I remember
                everyone wanting to be my friend, everyone wanting to touch the trophy. For the first time, I knew what
                it was like to be accepted. It felt exhilarating. Slowly but surely, it was through music that I was
                able to gain a sense of self-worth. It was music that gave me hope that something in me would make me
                feel accepted by my classmates. My school years went by with me being heavily involved in music; it was,
                and to date is my shield.

                Even though I no longer repulsed my peers, I still had a hard time talking to most of them and thought
                twice before expressing my thoughts, for there was a part of me that always believed that I was not good
                enough for them. Through the years, I have learnt to love and embrace myself as I am. There are still
                times where I feel worthless, but deep down, I know that this isn't true. The journey to self-love has
                been a slow and rocky one, but I've grown throughout the journey. My journey hasn't ended yet, but I
                know that there was and always will be hope.
