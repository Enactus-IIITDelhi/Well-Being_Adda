                Right from a little shy girl who wouldn’t talk to anyone to a much more confident person who is telling you this story, that's what self-love did to me.  To begin with, it's easy to love someone else but much more difficult to love yourself.  I have always been a studious kid who always felt that only my excellence in studies makes me noticeable and there is absolutely nothing else I am good at and the very obvious beauty notions set by the society come with it making me feel so much less unwanted and unloved.  I was always conscious about what I do what I say. I was a person who would rather jump out of a train than being the center of attention, always a loner. Cut to 2020, I love being center of attention, I say what I feel (even though sometimes I create a lot of trouble) and I absolutely love myself more than anybody else in this entire world. It feels like magic but it's not. It's just a series of constant efforts to explore my inner self and fall in love with her.

                Okay, just a question, when you fall in love with someone else you are ready to love them forever despite all their flaws, their looks, their success their failures nothing matters. What matters is how they are from inside. Then why can't you do the same with yourself?

                My journey of self-love began around 4-5 years back when I became a backbencher from a frontbencher, spending more time with friends than books, wondering why do they even like me, and then trying to find the answers. It took me a while to realize than I am so much more than just a brainy topper. I hated it when during school farewell everyone wrote "Topper” on my t-shirt. I wanted to show everyone I am so much more than that. There are other things I can be good at. It was followed by my drop year with a lot of self-questioning and telling myself what a failure I am. Why? Just because I dropped a year. If you ask me now, I will say I am so glad that I dropped a year, it was the best decision I took. Result: I got into IGDTUW, of course, it's not an IIT but in fact, better than an IIT. The people I have met here have played a huge role in my journey.  I can't stress enough on how important it is to stay with people who push you to do better, motivate you, and are there for you no matter what.  These people have stayed with me and have seen me at my best and at my worst.

                Now If you ask me about myself, I can talk endlessly about how many things I am good at, what a gem of a person I am, and why not just me, but everyone should fall in love with me. Not to deny, there are still so many days when I question myself, find a reason to hate myself, and trust me it's easy to find flaws in someone but it takes a whole heart to love. It is easy to blame yourself and curse for every wrong thing you do but what we forget is that it's okay to make mistakes, it's okay to not to be perfect.

                Your beauty lies in your imperfections That's what makes you unique. The struggle is real but it's worth it. It's fine to fight with yourself but never fall out of love with yourself. The world can be sometimes harsh and a bit cruel towards you but don’t give anyone else the power to make you question your self-worth. The world tells you to be kind towards others but first, learn to be kind towards yourself and trust me, you are amazing, so am I and so is everyone else.
